![Badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT&color=<GREEN>)

## Description

This project is a weather dashboard application. It fetches data from openweather API, and retrieves current weather data for the city inputted, as well as a 5 day forecast. It shows temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. It accomplishes this using fswrite and fsreadfile, taking the data and creating html and css dynamically. The framework I used is materialize. Also, this application utilizes local storage to keep recently searched cities, and render them to the page to easily hop between different city data.

## User Story

As a user, I wanted to fetch and display weather data in an organized manner, and allow users to searchthroug multiple cities easily with locally stored query data.
